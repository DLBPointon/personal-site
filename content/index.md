Hi, i'm Damon a Bioinformatician in the [Tree of Life Project](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/programme/tree-of-life/) (also found [here](https://www.darwintreeoflife.org/)) at Sanger, UK. In my role, I develop programs/websites and pipelines using Python, Rust, Nextflow and a bit of JavaScript to generate data to support genome assembly and curation.

Currently, some of the major projects I am working on are [[TreeVal]], [[ASCC]] and a handful of others. I am also the organiser for [The Biodiversity Genomics Academy](thebgacademy.org), a **Free and Open education** platform for aspiring bioinformaticians.

I am a bit of an wanna-be polyglot, I try to learn enough about a wide range of topics so that I can do it myself. A couple of examples include, learning how to [[Amys-sword|forge a sword]], [[WAKeyboard|design and build a keyboard]] and [[The-Vault|self-hosting]].
